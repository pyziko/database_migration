flask db init

flask db migrate

flask db upgrade   -->> this runs the script in migration/versions to upgrade
flask db downgrade -->> this runs the script in migration/versions to downgrade


*=================
If u have migrated and yet to upgrade, you can delete the script generated and that's fine.

when we change some details, we can do ::: flask db migrate

check current version
select * from alembic_version


if downgrade complains of constraints name:  go to the data grip and get constraints name and replace None with it
**** USE THE ANY NAME YOU CHOSE OR
=========
        OR use script to get the name
        ==========

this is for postgres
SELECT con.*
       FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint con
            INNER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_class rel
                       ON rel.oid = con.conrelid
            INNER JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace nsp
                       ON nsp.oid = connamespace
       WHERE nsp.nspname = '<schema name>'
             AND rel.relname = '<table name>';


To add message:::
    flask db migrate -m "Adding unique constraints"



clean-slate    --- delete versions and alembic table

==================================
Maintaining same naming convection across all dbs, we can do as shown in db.py
==================================
